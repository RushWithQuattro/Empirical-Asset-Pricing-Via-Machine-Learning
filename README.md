# Empirical-Asset-Pricing-Via-Machine-Learning

This projects follows the methpodology proposed by Gu et al. (2020). Gu et al conducted a comparative analysis of the machine learning techniques in measuring equity risk premiums on a panel of 30,000 US equities over 60 years from 1957 to 2016. 97 predictive features including company fundatmentals, macro-economics indicators, and trade price time data are used. This projects expands the feature sets to around 200, and implemented 3 classes of ML models mentioned in the literature: Linear Model with ElasticNe; Boosted Regression Tree and Random Forests; FeedForward Neural Networks. Hyperparameters, Model Specifications and Train-Val-Test splits follows the method of Gu et al., which can be found in the appendix.
